         The World Wide Web, or Simply the Web, has been a "Killer App" of the Internet. Certainly its capability to
         display text and grahics and provide access to other pages and information has made it the fastest growing
         component of the internet. Major online services are America Online, CompuServe and Prodigy.

         A way to access the web is to get an account with an Internet Service Provider, or ISP. Those accounts inculde
         access to the World Wide Web and other internet resources, and often provide space to store Web pages one will
         create. A very helpful feature of the web is the capability to move from page to page by selecting specific
         highlighted words and phrases or images which are called links.
