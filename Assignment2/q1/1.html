        The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for
        everyone. If the security breach at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center
        last year by the hackers group milwOrm didn't convience you of their
        capabilities, then consider this : James Davis aka jdavis_4, a resident
        of www.geecities.com/Silicon Valley/Bit/2483 homestead community on the
        Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now,
        or using your account for some begin Internet surfing, or exchanging it
        with someone else on the Net for more such accounts!

        Surprised? Or scared ?

        Whatever it is, jdavis_4 claims in his home page Free VSNL passwords
        that he has got exactly 108 working VSNL passwords (and growing daily),
